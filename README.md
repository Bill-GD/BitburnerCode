# Bitburner Code
 Some scripts for the game Bitburner which used JS to run scripts for automation.
 (Most of) These scripts were re-written from scratch while (mostly) keeping the basic flow of the original.
 These scripts won't run outside of the game (most things depend on the package provided by Bitburner (ns/NS))

# Reasons for using git
 Keep old versions of these scripts if I change them in the future
 Bitburner doesn't have any version control so if I change something and it broke, I can fix it with this.
 VSCode also has an extension to push scripts into the game so if I accidentally delete a script, I can recover it if it's up-to-date.
